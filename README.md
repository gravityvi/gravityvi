### Hi there 👋

I'm Ravi, your friendly neighborhood software developer. I thrive on solving problems and lending a helping hand. While I can't promise to commit all my time to open source (a developer needs coffee, too!), I'd gladly consider going full-time if enough sponsorship keeps my brain caffeinated and laptop happily humming. Let's code together and explore the endless possibilities! 💻☕️✨"
  
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a project written in Rust on IC (Internet Computer) platform.
- 🌱 I’m trying to learn Rust.
- 👯 I would be happy to help on [Nightwatch.js](https://nightwatchjs.org) as I am an active contributor and spend weekends killing bugs in the library.
